## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of US regional sales data to uncover actionable insights and trends. The dataset used is synthetic for the purpose of demonstrating data analysis techniques rather than representing actual data/trends. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to understand sales patterns, channel performance, and profitability. Using SQL for data manipulation and Google Sheets for creating an [interactive dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dijq-VLYPq0nCWAXwUoLafBWJh7JGqsTFhO5ov3vHUs/edit?usp=sharing), the project aims to provide insights into sales performance and strategic opportunities.

## Tools

- MySQL Workbench
- Google Sheets

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
### 1. Database Creation and Table Setup

Created a database USRegionalSales and created the SalesData table. The data was imported into MySQL Workbench using 'Table Data Import Wizard' for initial processing and analysis.

### 2. Data Type Adjustment
   Altered the following columns to DATE type:
- ProcuredDate
- OrderDate
- ShipDate
- DeliveryDate
### 3. Date Formatting
Corrected the date columns (ProcuredDate, OrderDate, ShipDate, DeliveryDate) to a standard YYYY-MM-DD format due to incorrect import formatting, ensuring consistency across the dataset.
### 4. Data Validation

- **Order Date Validation** - Verified the OrderDate occurred after DeliveryDate for each order.

- **Missing Values** - Checked for any missing values in essential columns like OrderNumber and SalesChannel.

- **Duplicates** - Checked for duplicate entries in the OrderNumber column.

### 5. Calculated Fields:
- **TotalRevenue:** Added and calculated based on OrderQuantity * UnitPrice.
- **TotalCost:** Added and calculated based on OrderQuantity * UnitCost.
- **Profit:** Added and calculated as TotalRevenue - TotalCost.
- **DiscountedRevenue:** Added and calculated as TotalRevenue - (TotalRevenue * DiscountApplied).


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA phase, several key questions were addressed to uncover insights and trends within the US Regional Sales Data:

- What is the total revenue and profit generated by each sales channel?
- How does revenue and profit vary by year and sales channel?
- What are the monthly sales trends and average monthly revenue?
- Which products and customers contribute the most to overall revenue and profit?
- How do revenue and order trends vary by weekday?

## Data Analysis

I utilized advanced SQL queries to gain deeper insights into the sales data. Key analyses and techniques included:

### Revenue by Sales Channel
```SQL
SELECT SalesChannel, ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue),2) AS TotalRevenue, ROUND(SUM(Profit),2) AS TotalProfit
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY SalesChannel
;
```
### Revenue and Profit by Sales Channel Over Time
```SQL
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM OrderDate) AS Year, 
       SalesChannel, 
       ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue), 2) AS TotalRevenue, 
       ROUND(SUM(Profit), 2) AS TotalProfit
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY Year, SalesChannel
ORDER BY Year, SalesChannel
;
```
### Sales Trends by Month and Year
```SQL
SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year, MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month, ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue),2) AS MonthlyRevenue
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY Year, Month
ORDER BY Year, Month
;
```
### Average Revenue by Month
```SQL
WITH MonthlyRevenue AS (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM OrderDate) AS Month,
        ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue), 2) AS TotalMonthlyRevenue
    FROM SalesData
    GROUP BY Month
),

AverageMonthlyRevenue AS (
    SELECT
        Month,
        ROUND(AVG(TotalMonthlyRevenue), 2) AS AvgMonthlyRevenue
    FROM MonthlyRevenue
    GROUP BY Month
)

SELECT
    Month,
    AvgMonthlyRevenue
FROM AverageMonthlyRevenue
ORDER BY Month
;
```
### Revenue and Order Trends by Weekday
```SQL
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(OrderDate) AS Weekday, 
       ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue), 2) AS TotalRevenue
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY Weekday
ORDER BY Weekday
;
```
### Top 10 Customers by Revenue
```SQL
SELECT _CustomerID, ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue),2) AS CustomerRevenue
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY _CustomerID
ORDER BY CustomerRevenue DESC
LIMIT 10
;
```
### Top 10 Products by Sales
```SQL
SELECT _ProductID, ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue),2) AS ProductSales
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY _ProductID
ORDER BY ProductSales DESC
LIMIT 10
;
```
### Calculate Gross Profit for Each Product and Find the Top 10 Products by Gross Profit
```SQL
SELECT _ProductID, 
       ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue),2) AS TotalRevenue, 
       ROUND(SUM(TotalCost),2) AS TotalCost, 
       ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue - TotalCost),2) AS GrossProfit
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY _ProductID
ORDER BY GrossProfit DESC
LIMIT 10
;
```
### Calculate the Number of Orders and Total Revenue by Year
```SQL
WITH YearlyStats AS (
    SELECT
        YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year,
        COUNT(DISTINCT OrderNumber) AS TotalOrders,
        ROUND(SUM(TotalRevenue),2) AS TotalRevenue
    FROM SalesData
    GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate)
),
-- Calculate percentage increases compared to the previous year
YearlyStatsWithIncreases AS (
    SELECT
        Year,
        TotalOrders,
        TotalRevenue,
        LAG(TotalOrders) OVER (ORDER BY Year) AS PreviousYearOrders,
        LAG(TotalRevenue) OVER (ORDER BY Year) AS PreviousYearRevenue
    FROM YearlyStats
)

SELECT
    Year,
    TotalOrders,
    TotalRevenue,
    CASE 
        WHEN PreviousYearOrders IS NULL THEN NULL 
        ELSE ROUND((TotalOrders - PreviousYearOrders) / PreviousYearOrders * 100, 2) 
    END AS OrdersPercentageIncrease,
    CASE 
        WHEN PreviousYearRevenue IS NULL THEN NULL 
        ELSE ROUND((TotalRevenue - PreviousYearRevenue) / PreviousYearRevenue * 100, 2) 
    END AS RevenuePercentageIncrease
FROM YearlyStatsWithIncreases
;
```

## Data Visualization
In the Data Visualization phase, I created several visualizations to effectively communicate the insights derived from the data.

**Dashboard Overview:** Developed a comprehensive [dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dijq-VLYPq0nCWAXwUoLafBWJh7JGqsTFhO5ov3vHUs/edit?usp=sharing) displaying key metrics, including total profit, total revenue, and annual revenue and profit. This allowed for a quick and intuitive overview of financial performance across different years.

**Revenue by Sales Channel:** Created a pie chart to illustrate the distribution of total revenue by sales channel, providing a clear visual representation of the contribution of each channel to overall sales.
